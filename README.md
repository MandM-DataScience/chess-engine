# Chess Engine

**Problem**: We want to develop a chess engine using 2 different methodologies:
- Classic (Minimax + Pruning) - like Stockfish
- Reinforcement Learning - like AlphaZero

We structured the project as a Data Science showcase, in which we explain the various steps we took in a series of 
Jupyter notebooks, containing both the code and the thought process.

### What we did:
1. [Chess Engine fundamentals and Minimax Algorithm](notebooks/chess_engine_minimax.ipynb) (chess board and move 
generation, minimax, alpha-beta pruning)
2. [Chess Engine Reinforcement Learning](notebooks/chess_engine_rl.ipynb) (state representation, action space, 
neural network architecture, reward signal, exploration strategy, agent training)
